          This is a must have page for almost all websites on the internet. You can name this page “About Us” or <br>
          “About Me” depending on whether you have a business blog or a single-author personal blog. <br>
		  You can use this page to tell users about people behind the website, its purpose, mission, values, <br>
		  and what users should expect to find on your blog. The about page helps build trust among your audience <br>
		  as they get to know the real people behind the scenes. You can also use this opportunity to showcase <br>
		  your most popular content.
