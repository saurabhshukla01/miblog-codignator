(14, 5, 1, 'hello title', 'hello-title', 'The meaning of a proper name is not the same as the object (if there is any) it refers to. Hence, though \"Pegasus\" refers to nothing, it still has a meaning. The German philosopher Gottlob Frege seems to have held a theory of this sort. He says that the sentence \"Odysseus was set ashore at Ithaca while sound asleep\" obviously has a sense. ... the thought [expressed by that sentence] remains the same whether \"Odysseus\" has reference or not.\" Bertrand Russell may also have held a similar theory, that a proper name is a disguised definite description that signifies some unique characteristic. If any object has this characteristic feature, the name has a referent. Otherwise it is empty. Perhaps \"Aristotle\" means \"the teacher of Alexander\". Since there was such a person, \"Aristotle\" refers to that person. By contrast, \"Pegasus\" may mean \"the winged horse of Bellerophon\". Since there was no such horse, the name has no referent. This is the so-called description theory of names. The difficulty with this account is that we may always use a proper name to deny that the individual bearing the name actually has some characteristic feature. So, we can meaningfully say that Aristotle was not the teacher of Alexander. But if \"Aristotle\" means \"teacher of Alexander\", it would follow that this assertion is self-contradictory, which it is not. Saul Kripke proposed this argument in a series of influential papers in the 1970s. Another difficulty is that different people may have different ideas about the defining characteristics of any individual. Yet we all understand what the name means. The sole information carried by the name seems to be the identity of the individual that it belongs to. This information therefore cannot be descriptive, it cannot describe the individual. As John Stuart Mill argued, a proper name tells us the identity of its bearer, without telling us anything else about it. Naming is rather like pointing.', 'pic29.jpeg', '2020-05-17 11:30:42'),

This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance.
